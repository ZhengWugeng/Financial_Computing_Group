# Financial Computing Group3 Project: Stock prediction model based on LSTM and ARIMA

In the README.md, there are divided into three parts. Please read me first then run the code.

[TOC]

# 1. Background

This is an individual project related to**Stock prediction model based on LSTM and ARIMA**. 

## 1.1 Dataset

Select Nvidia stock data from (https://www.nasdaq.com/) NASDAQ official website, which is the world's largest stock market. 

Select Nvidia's historical quotes. Download and process stock data from 1999-01-22 to 2021-11-12. We selected data that is from 2015-01-01.

The goal is to create two syock pridiction model and make prediction on test records. 

##  1.2 File Introduction
